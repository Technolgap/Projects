## Other Issues
### Figuring how people how to get people motivated and committed to working on their projects 
<b> Brainstorm: </b> 
- Working together on an issue (motivation + encouragement) == pair-programming
- Virutal check-in's `ex/ message people their progress` 

<b> What we tried: </b> 
- Setting "office hours"
